    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this block and unindented to actually change the configuration.

    # istio.sidecar.includeOutboundIPRanges specifies the IP ranges that Istio sidecar
    # will intercept.
    #
    # Replace this with the IP ranges of your cluster (see below for some examples).
    # Separate multiple entries with a comma.
    # Example: "10.4.0.0/14,10.7.240.0/20"
    #
    # If set to "*" Istio will intercept all traffic within
    # the cluster as well as traffic that is going outside the cluster.
    # Traffic going outside the cluster will be blocked unless
    # necessary egress rules are created.
    #
    # If omitted or set to "", value of global.proxy.includeIPRanges
    # provided at Istio deployment time is used. In default Knative serving
    # deployment, global.proxy.includeIPRanges value is set to "*".
    #
    # If an invalid value is passed, "" is used instead.
    #
    # If valid set of IP address ranges are put into this value,
    # Istio will no longer intercept traffic going to IP addresses
    # outside the provided ranges and there is no need to specify
    # egress rules.
    #
    # To determine the IP ranges of your cluster:
    #   IBM Cloud Private: cat cluster/config.yaml | grep service_cluster_ip_range
    #   IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service: "172.30.0.0/16,172.20.0.0/16,10.10.10.0/24"
    #   Google Container Engine (GKE): gcloud container clusters describe XXXXXXX --zone=XXXXXX | grep -e clusterIpv4Cidr -e servicesIpv4Cidr
    #   Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): "10.0.0.0/16"
    #   Azure Container Service (ACS; deprecated): "10.244.0.0/16,10.240.0.0/16"
    #   Azure Container Service Engine (ACS-Engine; OSS): Configurable, but defaults to "10.0.0.0/16"
    #   Minikube: "10.0.0.1/24"

    # clusteringress.class specifies the default cluster ingress class
    # to use when not dictated by Route annotation.
    #
    # If not specified, will use the Istio ingress.
    #
    # Note that changing the ClusterIngress class of an existing Route
    # will result in undefined behavior.  Therefore it is best to only
    # update this value during the setup of Knative, to avoid getting
    # undefined behavior.

    # TLS mode of Knative. There are three TLS modes: "Manual", "Auto", and "Force".
    # 1. "Manual" mode: No TLS certificates will be provisioned, and Gateway object will not be reconciled.
    # Operator needs to manually provision TLS certificates and configure Gateway to support TLS.
    # 2. "Auto" mode: TLS certificates will be provisioned, and Gateway object will be reconciled to terminate TLS connection.
    # For a given host, both HTTP connection and HTTPS connection will be supported.
    # 3. "Force" mode: TLS certificates will be provisioned, and Gateway object will be reconciled to terminate TLS connection.
    # For a given host, HTTPS will be supported. And HTTP connection will be redirected to HTTPS connection. The major difference btw AUTO and FORCE is the HTTP redirection.
    # If Istio is the ClusterIngress solution, then "Auto" and "Force" requires Istio 1.1 (or above)
    tlsMode: "Manual"
