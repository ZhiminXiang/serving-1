    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this block and unindented to actually change the configuration.

    # TLS mode of Knative. There are two TLS modes: "MANUAL" and "AUTO".
    # "MANUAL" mode: operator needs to provision TLS certificates and configure
    # gateway to enable TLS termination for Routes.
    # "AUTO" mode: Knative will be responsible for provisioning TLS certificates
    # and configure gateway to enable TLS termination for Routes. No manual work
    # is needed from operators.
    # If Istio is the ClusterIngress solution, then "AUTO" mode requires Istio 1.1 (or above)
    tls-mode: "MANUAL"
